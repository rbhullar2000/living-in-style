The high-end finishes, especially the Gaggenau kitchen and spa-style bathroom, made it feel like a high-end retreat.

The kitchen was modern and had everything we needed, and the community fire pit was a great touch for evening hangouts. The only thing I’d suggest is adding a couple more fans for the warmer nights."

It’s rare to find a place that feels remote yet is so close to all the fun of Cultus Lake. The hosts thought of everything — even board games and extra towels."
